Created Project folder for VAST 2019 MC1 Dataset

# OVERVIEW
Project is majorly focused on the effect of earthquake on a location called St.Himark which has around 19 locations. The dataset consists of fields named as roads and bridges, sewage and water, power, building, shake intensity etc which has values ranged from 1 - 10 based on the damage undergone.

The question which needs to be answered is to check for uncertainity in the data provided by the people from their locations throughout the 6 days period.

This change is being made from local repo and from Ashu's branch.
